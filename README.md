# Model and Features

The provided code implements a linear regression model to predict an individual's weight ('Weight (kg)'). It utilizes three features: 'Height (cm)', 'Physical Activity Level', and 'Smoking Status'. Before training the model, categorical features ('Physical Activity Level' and 'Smoking Status') were encoded into numerical representations using Label Encoding, and missing values were removed from the selected columns.

# Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance was evaluated using two common regression metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The calculated MSE is 154.67, and the RMSE is 12.44. The RMSE, being in the same units as the target variable (kg), indicates that, on average, the model's predictions are off by approximately 12.44 kilograms.

# Actual vs. Predicted Plot

The scatter plot visualizing the actual versus predicted weights provides a visual assessment of the model's accuracy. The points represent individual data points, with their actual weight on the x-axis and the model's predicted weight on the y-axis. The red dashed line represents the ideal scenario where predicted weight equals actual weight. The dispersion of the points around this line suggests that while the model captures some of the variance in weight, there is still a considerable amount of error, as indicated by the RMSE. The model's predictions are not perfectly aligned with the actual weights, implying that there might be other factors influencing weight that are not included in the current feature set, or that a linear model may not fully capture the complex relationship between the features and weight.
